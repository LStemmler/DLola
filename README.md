# DLola
Distributed version of the Lola specification language.
DLola is a version of the Lola stream-based specification language that allows the modeling and generation of communication routes for distributed systems.

This repository contains the DLola tool. It can turn DLola specifications into communication rules which can then be used to build Lola specifications and monitors.

More information on the Lola language can be found here:

# Contents
This repository contains two Eclipse projects:
- The main Java project containing the DLola tool 
- The ANTLR subproject in the "ANTLR DLola Projekt" folder defines the DLola syntax
Unless the latter needs to be changed, it suffices to use only the main project and the Java classes already pre-generated by ANTLR.

# Using the tool
The file "src/main/Global.java" defines the global variables used in the project, especially output verbosity and the size of types.
"DLolaRunner" is the main class. It takes the DLola file as argument.
The "src" folder contains several sample DLola specifications which can be used to test the tool.

The repository contains the pre-packaged jar file DLolaTool.jar. It should be run in a command line using a command akin to **java -jar DLolaTool.jar "./src/file1.dlola"**.

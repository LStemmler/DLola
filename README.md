# DLola
Distributed version of the Lola specification language.
DLola is a version of the Lola stream-based specification language that allows the modeling and generation of communication routes for distributed systems.

This repository contains the DLola tool. It can turn DLola specifications into communication rules which can then be used to build Lola specifications and monitors.
